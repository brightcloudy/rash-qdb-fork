rash-qdb-fork - IRC Quote Database System

This is a fork of the Rash Quote Management System (v 2.0 beta).

Rash is Copyright (C) 2003 Tom Cuchta (tommah@instable.net / http://www.mastergoat.com) and Instable Network (p00p@instable.net / http://www.instable.net), and can be found at http://rqms.sourceforge.net


Notes:

* PEAR::DB is needed, still.

* The database schema is different from the Rash 2.0 beta schema; The installer
  should be able to update your old database to the new format.
